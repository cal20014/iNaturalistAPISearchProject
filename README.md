# iNaturalist Coding Challenge

Connect to the **iNaturalist API**. Information can be found here: [iNaturalist API Documentation](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/).

## Features

1. **Search for Places**: Create a form that allows users to search for places using the API.

2. **Fetch Identifications**: Upon selecting a place, request the identifications associated with that location.

3. **Display Results**: Show the name and image of each identification returned in a visually appealing format.

## Stretch Goals

- **De-duplication**: Many of the identifications might be duplicates. Implement logic to de-duplicate the results before they are displayed.

- **Date Filtering**: Add the capability for users to filter identifications by observation date.
